# UberPvP
A Minecraft Arena PvP plugin developed for testing purposes.

Hello, my name is Tirth Patel and this is a personal project that I developed not only to enjoy the game through 
a different scope, but also to learn more about the realm of programming. I always try to build upon my coding 
knowledge and this, being one of my very first projects, has helped me achieve more than I ever imagined.
